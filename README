Complex Polynomial Dynamics
An effort at drawing various types of fractals,
through the complex polynomial iteration.

Until now the focus has been the Mandelbrot set
and Julia sets of the map z -> z ^ 2 + C for various
complex constants C.

Algorithms take advantage of a theorem, which states 
that if |z| > max(|C|, 2), then iterations of map
z -> z ^ 2 + C will diverge towards infinity.
